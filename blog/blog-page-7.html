                            The ecological axiom that: ‘Energy flow through a system tends to organize and simplify that
                            system’, is abundantly clear in agriculture. As farms moved from small interdependent units,
                            bounded by fences and hedgerows, to large cropping fields to accommodate machine
                            management, we lose the biodiversity that once existed on that landscape and the biomass that
                            provided the Ecosystem Services. This sacrifice was rationalized through the invocation of
                            economic profit. The economic ‘profit’ gained by subsidies on fossil fuel and uncontrolled
                            extraction from the Global Commons. The ‘development’ of agriculture has become a race to
                            control the commodity market. The farmer ceased to be a feature of the farm. In a telling
                            statement, the farmers of Sri Lanka sent the following statement to the CGIAR in 1998 :
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ‘We, the farmers of Sri Lanka would like to further thank the CGIAR, for taking an interest in us.
                            We believe that we speak for all of our brothers and sisters the world over when we identify
                            ourselves as a community who are integrally tied to the success of ensuring global food security.
                            In fact it is our community who have contributed to the possibility of food security in every
                            country since mankind evolved from a hunter-gather existence. We have watched for many
                            years, as the progression of experts, scientists and development agents passed through our
                            communities with some or another facet of the modern scientific world. We confess that at the
                            start we were unsophisticated in matters of the outside world and welcomed this input. We
                            followed advice and we planted as we were instructed. The result was a loss of the varieties of
                            seeds that we carried with us through history, often spanning three or more millennia. The result
                            was the complete dependence of high input crops that robbed us of crop independence. In
                            addition, we farmers producers of food, respected for our ability to feed populations, were
                            turned into the poisoners of land and living things, including fellow human beings. The result in
                            Sri Lanka is that we suffer from social and cultural dislocation and suffer the highest pesticiderelated death toll on the planet. Was this the legacy that you the agricultural scientists wanted
                            to bring to us ? We think not. We think that you had good motives and intentions, but left things
                            in the hands of narrowly educated, insensitive people.’

                                The diverse farm had to yield to production monoculture, which was made possible through the
                                burning of fossil fuels. Ironically the burning of fossil fuels is the major reason for the current
                                destabilized climate and threat to agriculture. One consequence of climate change is the
                                predicted rise in global temperatures. If ambient temperatures exceed 40 degrees , which has
                                become the reality in many places even today, food production will be compromised. All the food
                                we eat originates with plants and plants produce using photosynthesis. Photosynthesis, or the
                                capture of solar energy by plants, is done with chlorophyll, the thing that makes plants green and
                                chlorophyll begins to break down after 40 degrees. Landscapes whose summer temperatures go
                                beyond this limit will have smaller and smaller crops as the temperatures increase. The only
                                solution to this oncoming crisis, is to begin introducing trees at strategic points on the landscape.

                            Trees and all other forms of vegetation cool the environment around them through the
                            transpiration process, which takes place in the leaves. The water absorbed by the roots is sent
                            up to the leaves which release it as vapor, cooling the air around it. Measurements on trees done
                            by research institutions worldwide, indicate that an average large tree produces the cooling
                            equivalent of eight room sized air conditioners running for 10 hours, a cooling yield 0f 1,250,000
                            Bthu per day. Plantations of trees have been recoded to have daytime temperatures at least 3
                            degrees below the ambient. This is an important aspect of Ecosystem Services that needs to be
                            considered for adaptive agriculture.

                            Small farms which produce food with low external energy and maintain high biomass and
                            biodiversity, are the models of food production that can face the climate compromised future
                            before us. Capital, resource and energy expensive agricultural systems could fail in a high
                            temperature future and threaten global food security, we need options. One would be to
                            encourage a consumption and distribution system that facilitates small farmers to enter the
                            market. Another would be to realize the value of the ecosystem services of a farm and develop
                            systems to measure and reward. We are all aware of the future before us. Now is not the time
                            to stand blinking like a deer facing the headlights.

                                    But placing trees in and around cropping areas becomes a problem in large cropping fields
                                    designed to accommodate machine management. The management of such trees and
                                    hedgerows requires needs that cannot be provided without human management. Agricultural
                                    landscapes will need management that will be adaptive to the changing climate. An example
                                    would be; small interdependent units bounded by fences and that increase biodiversity and the
                                    biomass while providing Ecosystem Services.

                                    Investment in food security, should take climate change seriously. All new agricultural projects
                                    should address the heat thresholds of the planned crops. The Sri Lankan country statement at
