Still, food loss or waste <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2018/tackling-1.6-billion-ton-food-loss-and-waste-crisis">claims</a> 1.6 billion tons of food worth an
                            estimated $1.2 trillion each year. That represents a third of global food production.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What’s   behind   this   glaring   incongruity?   Poor   or   outdated production techniques are major culprits. As the Boston Consulting Group <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2018/tackling-1.6-billion-ton-food-loss-and-waste-crisis">highlights</a>, 500 million tons of food are lost or wasted at the
                            production stage 47 percent more than the 340 million tons lost or wasted by consumers every year.

                            into even sharper relief. But while the scale of the challenge is undeniably significant, agricultural technologies offer a pathway to a more sustainable future one in which farmers can both improve
                            their yields and drive down waste. Artificial intelligence, data analytics, and even drones are among the solutions that will reshape the future of farming making it more intelligent, more
                            efficient and better for the planet.

                        PRECISION AGRICULTURE 
                    </h3>
                    <br>
                    <div class="blog-contents">
                        <p>
                            To many minds, agriculture is still conceptually linked to an earlier pastoral mode of life. No one would deny agriculture’s vital role in modern society, but farms’ geographic distance from the urban core seems to lead to a certain disconnect with the high-tech economy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But with companies like Google being enlisted to help farmers improve yields and optimize production through artificial intelligence, it’s clear that a new kind of agriculture is taking root. Born in the 1990s, precision agriculture aims to leverage state-of-the-art 
                            technologies to bring more accuracy and control crop production, with an eye toward boosting yields and curbing waste.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Utilizing geographic information system (GIS) software, for example, farmers can view their crops through heat maps, in which red indicates dead fields and green indicates healthy ones. Green fields call for more fertilizer or insecticides, while farmers could avoid 
                            wasting those products on fields that would not produce high yields. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since the 1990s, precision agriculture has seen exponential growth. Hundreds of precision agriculture companies have emerged, employing everything from drones to robotics to autonomous tractors. Farmers can now have unprecedented insight into where each seed has been 
                            planted, enabling them to fertilize their crops with near-perfect accuracy something that was never an option when precision agriculture first came onto the scene.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Agriculture is moving past gleaning knowledge via aerial or ground imagery, with the industry making great strides toward actionable insights. Machine learning technology is bringing new advances to heat maps, which can now depict terrain in greater detail than ever before. 
                            Farming’s future increasingly lies in real-time responses, as more and more agricultural tech companies vie to provide all-in-one platforms with insights and prescriptions on-the-go.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Employing precision technologies like IoT sensors (measuring light, humidity, temperature, soil moisture, etc.) and AI platforms will help the agriculture industry overcome some of its most pressing challenges, from meeting the needs of a rising global population to dealing 
                            with a changing climate all while cutting back on destructive food waste.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the precision agriculture market expands forecasters predict that it will reach $6.43 billion in 2022, up from $2.81 billion in 2014 demand for drone solutions is set to rise.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It’s no surprise that drones are slated to play a big part in making agriculture more efficient and cost-effective. Providing precise, highly detailed 3-D maps for soil and field analysis, drones will drive better decision-making about irrigation and crop management. 
                            Agricultural drones can do much more than monitor crops and assess their health: Drone-based planting systems, thanks to their remarkable precision, can <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2016/07/20/158748/six-ways-drones-are-revolutionizing-agriculture/">reduce planting costs by 85 percent</a>, according to PwC. Guided by GPS, drones can also spray crops with unparalleled 
                            accuracy—<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45020853">decreasing pesticide use</a> by as much as 30 percent.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Satellite imagery, once seen as a game-changing technology for farming, pales in comparison to drones’ capabilities. Drones’ high-resolution imagery and dynamic, 3-D mapping mark a vast improvement over the static, relatively low-resolution solutions offered by satellite 
                            imagery—and the shift toward drones is a matter of more than just sleeker technology. It’s moving the needle in the quest to forge a more sustainable future for agriculture.

                            The shift towards precision agriculture will usher in significant changes to the farming supply chain. A new crop of retailers, focused on innovative technologies like advanced drone monitoring and predictive analytics, will emerge. Because agricultural retailers know 
                            the ins and outs of their local sectors, they will be best-positioned to offer precision agriculture solutions for farmers, offering services of more value at a time when the health and sustainability of the industry demands it.

                            A new breed of e-commerce focused on agriculture will also change the game of farming, making it easier for farmers to buy in bulk online bringing more efficiency to the logistical chain between retailers and farmers. Given farming’s traditional orientation toward human 
                            interaction, the shift toward digitization in the era of precision agriculture will come with challenges. Trust will be key, as farmers seek to buy products from suppliers with longstanding industry expertise. Traditional agricultural retailers therefore stand to gain big 
                            from entering the farming e-commerce space, with their deep roots in the industry uniquely positioning them to help lead farming’s digital transition.

                            While the demand for digital solutions is high and remains on an upward trajectory, there are many steps to be taken before precision agriculture is widely adopted and can make its biggest impact. Some of these steps relate to farmers, some to the development of the 
                            technologies themselves, and still others to the retail chain as a whole.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But those challenges pale in comparison to the dire consequences of failing to harness technology for the good of both agriculture and the planet. Farming and high-tech may seem an unlikely marriage, but its fruits will be borne out in better yields, lower waste and greater 
                            environmental sustainability.
