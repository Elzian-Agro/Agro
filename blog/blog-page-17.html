                        <p>
                            Farming is the occupation of many people in Sri Lanka. Farm 
                            business has assumed greater importance not only in developed and 
                            commercial agriculture all around the world but also in developing 
                            and subsistence types of agriculture. A farm manager must not 
                            understand different methods of agricultural production, but also he 
                            must be concerned with their costs and returns. He must know how to 
                            allocate scarce productive resources on the farm business to meet his 
                            goals and at the same time react to economic forces that arise from 
                            both within and outside the farm.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For the owner who runs a farm, there are a number of aspects to the 
                            farm that need to be addressed. A farm can have many things such as 
                            animal husbandry, crop cultivation, and ornamental floriculture, 
                            mushroom cultivation. Maintaining a farm is a really difficult task. 
                            When planting a seedling, it is essential to take care of the fertility of 
                            the soil as well as to provide timely water for their cultivation. 
                            Watering the plant is a must when growing crops. At the same time, 
                            in animal husbandry on the farm, they must be provided with the food 
                            they need and the cleaning of their habitat. Greenhouses can be found 
                            on most farms. Even the work in the greenhouses should be done in a 
                            very systematic manner. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            It takes a lot of time for a farmer to complete one task on his farm. 
                            For example, it takes a long time for a farmer to provide water for his 
                            plants. Then he has very little time to spend on the rest of the work on 
                            the farm. His income decreases as efficiency decreases. There is no 
                            way to quickly become aware of an emergency. For example , in the 
                            event of a fire, such as a disaster on the farm, there is no safety system 
                            in place to quickly alert and minimize the disaster. The loss to the 
                            farm due to the inability to know such a disaster situation is immense. 
                            There is no way to even know about a person or animal that is 
                            trespassing on the farm at night. For this reason, the security of the 
                            farm is very low.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Greenhouses can be found on most farms. Even the work in the 
                            greenhouses should be done in a very systematic manner. Solving the 
                            problems mentioned earlier is not a difficult task in modern times. 
                            The farmer does not need to go to the farm to water his plants and can 
                            water himself from his own house. The farmer can monitor the 
                            temperature, and humidity of the environment and send the data to the 
                            database. A security system can also be created to notify the owner in 
                            the event of a disaster such as a farm fire. A security system can be 
                            put in place to alert the farmer if an outsider or animal enters. 
                            Therefore, you can easily and cheaply get such an essential, useful 
                            and secure system from <a href="https://agro.elzian.com/">Elzian Agro</a> 
                            to your farm. And if you have any other requirements, we have the ability 
                            to look into them and provide a highly functional system to your farm.
