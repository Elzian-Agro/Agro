                            Soil is the major component in a farm ecosystem. It acts as the main supportive structure for 
                            plants in agriculture and provides the main sources of nutrients and water to the plants. Soil 
                            is the combination of mineral fragments, water, air and organic matter. Itâ€™s mostly containing 
                            grains of rock weathered by wind, rain and a varying amount of humus. Among these, organic 
                            matter holds a 5% contribution to the soil. Organic matter contributes to the living hood of the soil. 
                            Organic matter is the heart of the soil which gives life to the soil.
                        </p>

                        <br>

                        <p>
                            Soil Organic Matter consists with, 
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Fresh plant residues and Living organisms,</strong> including Micro and macro-organisms living inside the soil.</li>
                            <li><strong>Decomposing/act organic matter,</strong> includes physical breakdown and biochemical transformations of the 
                                organic compounds. The active fraction of organic matter readily changes the mass and form of the soil. 
                                This portion is unstable in the soil and mostly affected by management practices such as tillage, 
                                cover crops, crop rotations, irrigation methods and due to climatic factors such as temperature and rainfall etc. 
                                The rapid turnover of the active fraction can contribute to nutrient release for crops as for their requirement. </li>
                            <li><strong>Stable organic matter/ humus,</strong> the most valuable constituent of the soil. It consists of decomposed organic matter 
                                that has been converted by microorganisms to a resistant state of decomposition. Humus enhances the fertility 
                                of the soil by acting as a pool of nutrients, increasing the water holding capacity of the soil, improving soil 
                                structure, and providing a source of energy for living soil organisms. </li>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                Increasing levels of Organic Matter improve the physical, chemical, and biological functions of the soil.
                            </p>

                                    <li>Biological Functions such as increasing the biological diversity and the microbial activity of the soil. 
                                        Microorganisms excrete compounds that also act as a binding agent for soil particles, which can increase 
                                        aggregate stability, water infiltration, and water holding capacity. </li>
                                    <li>Organic matter is a valuable nutrient source for plants and living organisms. For every % of Organic Matter 
                                        in the top 6 inches of a medium-textured soil (silt and loam soils), approximately 10-20 lbs. of nitrogen, 
                                        1-2 lbs. of phosphorus, and 0.4-0.8 lbs. of sulfur are released per acre annually (USDA-NRCS, 2014). 
                                        Other than that Organic particles contain sites of negative charges that attract and hold positively charged 
                                        ions such as calcium, potassium, magnesium, and ammonium (nitrogen).</li>
                                    <li>Organic matter causes soil particles to bind and form stable soil aggregates, which improves soil structure.</li>
                                    <li>Improve the Water Holding Capacity of the soil. Organic matter behaves similar to a sponge, with the ability 
                                        to absorb and hold up to 90% of its weight in water. </li>
                                    <li>Control the soil erosion by increasing the aggregating ability. It helps to stabilize the soil.</li>

                                </ul>
                                <br>
                                <p>Therefore maintaining soil organic matter content helps to maintain healthy soil and increase the soil productivity. </p>

                                Several factors such as climate, soil type, a crop grown, and specific management
                                practices can each influence the amount of soil Organic Matter regionally or in
                                specific fields.  Minimize tillage or adopt a no-till cause to slower the soil organic
                                residue decomposition and gives greater protection to the soil from erosion. Add
                                crop residues to the soil including cover crops, organic matter (ex: compost,
                                residues,), or growing a high biomass/yielding crop rotation. That helps to protect
                                the soil surface from raindrop impact, and erosion and adds carbon back to the soil.

                            Soil organic matter plays a major role in sustaining ecosystems by regulating nutrient cycles and improving 
                            physical  properties  as  described  earlier.  It  is  an  important  source  of  nitrogen,  phosphorus  potassium, 
                            other macronutrients and other micronutrients.  The quantity of soil organic matter is dependent on the 
                            balance  between  usability  and  the  speed  of  decomposition.  It  is  difficult  to  predict  the  amount  of  soil 
                            organic matter because it is very heterogeneous and because its behavior is affected by soil texture. The 
                            presence of silt and clay generally preserves some C from primary production and increases soil organic 
                            matter under certain environments. Therefore determining the soilâ€™s organic content is important to have 
                            a favorable farming ecosystem for crop production and the productivity of agriculture.
