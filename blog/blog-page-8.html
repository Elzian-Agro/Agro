                            Digitization of agriculture is the only method one can follow inorder to increase the competitiveness 
                            of agricultural production in a short time, even during the first two years of implementation. Most of 
                            the other solutions of improving farming productivity often take a long time over 10 years to give their 
                            full effects.  <i>Experience shows that use of digital agriculture solutions during the first two years has 
                            already helped farmers to increase their profitability from 50% up to 100%.</i>  Higher earnings supported by 
                            digitalization make agriculture more attractive while providing the best motivation for the new generation 
                            of farmers to take over the family business and expand their farms.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="sub-heading fw-bolder">
                            Digitization Prevents Triple Losses on Farms 
                        </h3>
                        <br>

                        <p>
                            Digital solutions have become a great help in giving excellent benefits to farmers in terms of avoiding 
                            the triple loss they have during the year. <i>Farmers experience their first loss while planning the production.</i> 
                            It is impossible to optimally calculate the necessary inputs for the season, without precise data such as 
                            soil quality and actual crop needs for the season. According to the proven results of many studies and our 
                            confirmation with thousands of famers who are using our software for managing farm production, digitalization 
                            and precision agriculture reduce losses on fertilizers, crop protection, and other inputs in production even 
                            up to 30 percent.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <i>The wrong judgment of farmers when to apply agricultural practices is the major reason for the second 
                            loss during the season.</i> Late crop protection against pests and disease causes 20 to 40 percent yield 
                            losses every year. This has been identified as one of the main reasons which impacts on yields. However, 
                            digital solutions have become a great help for farmers when making timely decisions based on facts and 
                            the real-time situation in fields. For example, <a href="https://agro.elzian.com/index">ELZIAN AGRO</a> continuously monitors weather conditions on 
                            fields and alerts farmers when there is a risk of bad weather or any signs of pests and diseases.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <i>Farmers experience their third loss while selling the product when the price for their crops depends 
                            on actual quality and ability to guarantee food safety.</i> The demand to prove the <a href="https://agro.elzian.com/traceability">traceability</a> of food 
                            is growing, both from consumers and retailers who buy directly from farmers. Farmers need to showcase 
                            each product when and where it was planted, how it was treated and its nutritive value.  Therefore, in 
                            order to show the transparency of this information, digitization of each stage of production is essential.  
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The experience of farmers is important when digitizing the steps of production.  It removes triple 
                            losses in farming production, gives results which can be measured, and helps farmers gain more 
                            profit and secure a better life. Implementation of digital solutions is not difficult.  Farmers 
                            can start using them fast despite the size of their production. <a href="https://agro.elzian.com/AgroMate">ELZIAN AGRO Automation 
                            Solutions</a> are available on computers and smart mobile phones which can be easily operated. 
                            <i>The only thing that the farmers have to do is to keep their discipline to enter data regulary. 
                            All the other details such as information and suggestions to warning alarms are provided by the 
                            platform itself.</i> The greatest advantage of this is, with a simple motivation, farmers will be 
                            able to get 50%-100% profit in their pockets. 
                        </p>
