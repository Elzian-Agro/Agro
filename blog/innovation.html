                Today, we’re taking a deep dive into the ocean. Oceans are central to our planet’s climate system. They regulate temperatures, host a vast array of biodiversity, and here’s a crucial point – they absorb about a quarter of all CO2 emissions, acting as a massive carbon sink.

But this isn’t without consequence. Ocean acidification is a direct result of climate change. It’s a silent crisis happening beneath the waves, triggering a mass extinction of coral reefs and the diverse ecosystems that depend on them. 

And, then there’s the crisis of plastics – 10 million tons of plastic enter the ocean each year.

These threats are real and immediate, but so is the potential for innovation. 

In this episode, we’re joined by two people working hard to restore ocean health. Brandon Levy is Chief Program Officer at Sustainable Ocean Alliance, and Bodhi Patil is an activist and organizer who founded Ocean Uprise, a platform enabling thousands of young people to support ocean activism. Both Brandon and Bodhi have their fingers on the pulse of the global effort to restore our oceans’ health. 

Despite the daunting challenges facing our oceans, this conversation was truly inspiring and I’m sure you’ll enjoy it. Here we go.

                    Brandon, the Chief Program Officer at SOA, was born and raised in New York, coming from a family of mental health professionals. His passion for social studies and global issues led him to explore practical and spiritual ways to make a significant impact on the planet. 

Brandon’s career initially focused on renewable energy investment and innovation, having worked at the California Clean Energy Fund, CalCharge, and CalSeed, but a pivotal moment came when he learned about the ocean’s role in combating climate change by absorbing carbon emissions.

Motivated to protect this vital ecosystem, Brandon joined forces with Daniela Fernandez, the founder and CEO of SOA. Together, they developed an innovative model to address the ocean’s needs, combining technology accelerators and venture funds with a focus on human well-being. Brandon’s multifaceted role includes growing innovation efforts and spearheading the Ocean Leadership Program, which offers grants, mentorship, coaching, and capacity-building opportunities for young leaders.

Approaching his five-year mark at Sustainable Ocean Alliance, Brandon continues to learn and grow while deepening his understanding of the ocean’s immense impact on our planet. By nurturing a symbiotic relationship with nature, he envisions a future where humanity coexists harmoniously with the ocean, creating a more habitable and sustainable world for generations to come.

                        Bodhi has had a global upbringing, experiencing firsthand the inequalities and environmental challenges faced by frontline communities. At the age of four, a transformative snorkeling trip with his father in Bali ignited his passion for ocean conservation and his understanding of our interconnectedness with the ocean.

Throughout his journey, Bodhi leveraged his diverse skill set, including storytelling and community building, to educate and power movements. When he was in sixth grade, he co-founded InnerLight, a business focused on empowering young people and addressing climate and mental health issues. In high school, he founded Ocean Uprise, a youth activist platform and initiative of Parley for Oceans, dedicated to protecting the oceans and educating the next generation of ocean guardians.

Bodhi’s vision is to connect people and share stories, nurturing a network of young ocean leaders who can scale their impact and drive systemic change. With over 5,000 community members and a strong emphasis on intergenerational collaboration, Ocean Uprise aims to transform the ocean space and promote the understanding that ocean health is intricately intertwined with human health.

                        Brandon acknowledges the significant challenges facing our planet’s oceans and recognizes the urgent need for action. Overfishing, mass extinction events, plastic pollution, and agricultural runoff are just a few of the issues causing harm to ocean ecosystems. Climate change poses an additional threat, with rising temperatures projected to lead to the extinction of coral reefs within the next 80 years.

SOA takes an audacious approach to address these challenges. Through their programs, they support young leaders like Bodhi in their grassroots initiatives and community organizing efforts. SOA has also accelerated 266 solutions in 77 countries, with a focus on youth-led projects that can scale effectively. By providing funding and resources, SOA aims to foster the growth of innovative startups, nonprofits, and campaigns dedicated to solving ocean-related issues.

SOA’s unique position lies in their ability to allocate funding across various types of projects, from grassroots initiatives to large-scale multinational companies. They prioritize the sustainable blue economy and aim to create “blue jobs” while investing in projects that demonstrate potential for growth and impact. Through the activation of young people and the mobilization of an ocean workforce, SOA is optimistic about restoring the health of our oceans within our lifetime.

                        Brandon explains that ocean investment is currently inadequate, with oceans receiving the least funding of all Sustainable Development Goals and a funding gap of $150 billion per year. Philanthropy contributes only $1 billion annually, highlighting the need for increased financial support for projects addressing ocean health holistically. To address this issue, initiatives like Seabird Ventures, a small venture fund, provide follow-on funding for impactful and scalable startups. Collaborative approaches are also being explored, seeking co-investors with a Triple Bottom Line approach and working with organizations like 1000 Ocean Startups to develop unified frameworks that promote investment and boost investor confidence in both profitable and impactful ventures.

To ensure a focused investment portfolio, five key areas of ocean health impact are considered: blue carbon and carbon removal, waste reduction and circular economy, ecosystem preservation and restoration, blue foods (fisheries, aquaculture, and seafood alternatives), and ocean data literacy and research. These impact pillars align with science-based goals and guide the sourcing and allocation of projects.

Creating a pipeline for investment involves adopting a broad-based approach that encompasses both small-scale projects in countries like Kenya and Indonesia, as well as more mature companies. This strategy increases the chances of identifying highly impactful initiatives and fosters a holistic ecosystem where successful startups can collaborate with smaller initiatives to raise awareness, conduct citizen science testing, and penetrate new markets. The aim is to build a collaborative network of innovative solutions globally, creating a supportive environment that complements and strengthens the impact of each venture.

                      <h3><b>What we need to know about deep-sea mining</b></h3>
                  </div>

                  <p>
                    Bodhi emphasizes the importance of understanding deep-sea mining and its implications for humanity. The deep sea holds great significance as a shared heritage, being both the origin of life and a source of spiritual and cultural practices, including Hawaiian values. It is crucial to recognize that the deep sea belongs to everyone and is regulated by the United Nations through the International Seabed Authority.
                  </p>

                  <P>
                    Deep-sea mining involves extracting mineral-rich sediment, such as lithium, iron, copper, and zinc, from the ocean floor, primarily for use in electrifying public vehicles. However, numerous news articles, including those from sources like The New York Times and The Guardian, highlight the existential and irreversible damage deep seabed mining would cause to ocean health. This practice essentially introduces a massive industrial operation into an untouched ecosystem, harming the very foundation of ocean well-being.
                  </P>

                  <p>
                    Given the limited exploration of the deep sea, it is imperative to deepen our scientific understanding of this realm before engaging in any mining activities. Consequently, various groups, including indigenous peoples from the Pacific and around the world, are advocating for a ban on deep-sea mining at the International Seabed Authority. Time is of the essence, as the two-year rule since Nauru issued the permission for deep seabed permitting in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone is nearing its deadline in June.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    To prevent the initiation of this extractive industry, individuals can take action in three ways. Firstly, they can sign petitions and agreements pledging not to support deep-sea mining or purchase minerals obtained from such activities. Notably, companies like BMW, Volkswagen, and Volvo have already committed to this cause. Secondly, young people can join movements and sign declarations rejecting seabed mining, raising their voices and making a resounding impact. Lastly, through collective efforts like those of the youth-led ocean climate platform, Look Down Action, people can organize events and advocate for a ban on deep-sea mining in their respective countries.
