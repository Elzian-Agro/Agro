                                Does ' Being Eco-friendly 'work as a help for creating a green world? 
                                According to the UK government, a workplace which works under the 'Green 
                                concept' will have a great benefit for not just the business but for the 
                                whole world. In the modern era, having a 'Green Workplace' is a valuable 
                                asset for reaching a good outcome; especially from the agricultural sector. 
                                Because modern agriculture faces many challenges. Pollution, biodiversity 
                                loss, soil degradation, water scarcity, carbon foot-print & natural resource 
                                depletion are some of the major challenges to the sustainability of the world's 
                                agriculture. Since sustainable agriculture addresses natural pollution, 
                                cares for living beings & saves natural resources; the time has come to 
                                support sustainability. So a workplace; which is environmentally sensitive, 
                                resource efficient & socially responsible, can be a key for it. Additionally, 
                                a green workplace can also improve employee well-being, increase productivity 
                                & attract environmentally-conscious consumers. Overall, being eco-friendly 
                                and creating green workplaces can play a crucial role in promoting sustainability 
                                and protecting our planet's resources for future generations.

                            </p>

                            <p>
                                As organizations become increasingly aware of the impact of their operations 
                                on the environment, the role of HRM in promoting sustainability and environmental 
                                responsibility; has become more important. As a vision for creating 'green 
                                griculture' ; here are some ways in which the HRM process in a workplace should 
                                be organized
                            </p>

                            <h4 class="header" style="font-weight: bold;"> 1. Set Sustainable Goals</h4>
                            
                            <p>
                                Creating a sustainable and green agriculture system in the workplace can be 
                                a challenging task, but it is essential for preserving the environment and 
                                ensuring long-term success. A workplace which can promote organic farming 
                                practices, biodiversity, renewable energy sources; will be the major guide 
                                for employees to support sustainable agriculture. Companies in the modern 
                                world  like <a href="https://agro.elzian.com/">Elzian Agro</a> , which always support sustainable agriculture; are 
                                practicing sustainable goals with employees for creating a green agriculture 
                                with green workplace. The UK government is the one who started this with 
                                workplaces at first.

                            </p>

                            <h4 class="header" style="font-weight: bold;"> 2. Educated Employees </h4>
                            
                            <p>
                                Educating employees who are well aware about the importance of sustainability 
                                and the actions ; they can take to support a green agriculture system can help 
                                to create a culture of sustainability in the workplace. This can be achieved 
                                through training sessions, workshops, and other educational programs. Elzian 
                                Agro is the best example for it. Employees who are open to learning and 
                                continuously improving can help in keeping up with the latest sustainable 
                                agriculture practices. Do you know?The world has started to run with <a href="https://masschallenge.org/articles/agriculture-innovation/">Agriculture</a> .
                            </p>

                            <h4 class="header" style="font-weight: bold;"> 3. Promote 'One Family'</h4>

                            <p>
                                Employees who are innovative and creative, can come up with new ideas for 
                                sustainable agriculture practices. They can find new ways to reduce the use 
                                of pesticides and fertilizers, conserve water, and reduce waste. Good 
                                communication & collaboration between all employees is the best path for it. 
                                Employees who are good communicators and collaborators can help in building 
                                partnerships with other stakeholders such as farmers, suppliers, and customers. 
                                They can work together to develop sustainable agriculture practices that benefit 
                                veryone. According to a latest report of ILO( The International Labour Organization), 
                                workers who are of any educated or social background, can create a green environment, 
                                green world. Good communication & collaboration  with  employees is the main need for it.

                            <h4 class="header" style="font-weight: bold;"> 4. Admiration & Rewarding</h4>

                            <p>
                                When employees feel appreciated and recognized for their hard work, they are 
                                more likely to feel motivated and committed to their job. This can result in 
                                increased productivity, better performance, and a positive attitude towards 
                                their work. Supporting green agriculture is an important cause that can benefit 
                                not only the environment but also the society as a whole. By encouraging and 
                                supporting employees to take part in initiatives that promote green agriculture, 
                                companies can contribute to a sustainable future while also enhancing their 
                                corporate social responsibility. Many agri companies in the world have started 
                                to introduce professional development opportunities to their employees as rewardings. 
                                <a href="https://www.nifa.usda.gov/grants/funding-opportunities/agriculture-food-research-initiative-education-workforce-development">The Department of Agriculture in the US</a> is the best example for it.
                            </p>

                            <h4 class="header" style="font-weight: bold;"> 5. Interactive Sessions</h4>

                            <p>
                                Interactive sessions in a workplace allow individuals to share their knowledge 
                                and ideas on green agriculture. These also provide opportunities for collaboration 
                                and networking among individuals with similar interests in green agriculture. 
                                Interactive sessions can serve as a platform for education and training on green 
                                agriculture practices. And also can be used to identify challenges and problems 
                                related to green agriculture, and to develop solutions to challenges. Modern companies 
                                in every sectors organize these kind of sessions always. <br/><br>
                                By implementing these green 
                                HRM practices, companies like <a href="https://agro.elzian.com/">Elzian Agro</a>  which works friendly with agriculture  can 
                                promote sustainability in agriculture and contribute to a more sustainable future.

                                The soil is comprised of two distinct fractions called the 'organic (biological) fraction' and 'inorganic (chemical/physical) fraction'.There is a slow flow between them in the form of mineralisation and decomposition.
