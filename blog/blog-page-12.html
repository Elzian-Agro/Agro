                            The discussion on ‘Economic Development’ as a national goal, must
                            demonstrate a perspective strongly rooted in modern science. However, the
                            goals of today suggest that our appreciation of the scientific method of
                            evaluation is a little short. Nevertheless, it is hoped that Sri Lanka’s
                            contribution at the Rio + 20 and at other international conventions that
                            discuss the common future of mankind can propose something innovative
                            rather than the mediocre dribble of the past. Having been party to these
                            processes, the probability of a repetition of past mediocrity is great. Thus in
                            the interest of the profile of this nation and in the interest of a benign future
                            for our children, the following reasoning is advanced. One hopes that the Sri
                            Lankan delegates to the various international conventions this year will raise
                            the need to ‘value photosynthetic biomass’ at all plenary sessions as a
                            national contribution.
                        </p>

                        <br>

                        <p>
                            Life on Earth learnt how to maintain gas and material flows, optimum for the
                            evolution and sustainability of biodiversity. Carbon Dioxide, although
                            essential to the process of life, was often introduced into the atmosphere by
                            volcanic processes at disruptive levels, throughout geologic history. But the
                            gas has not concentrated in the atmosphere, because it was sequestered by
                            living things and put away out of circulation from the biosphere of living
                            carbon, so that the environment was stable for life. This store of carbon was
                            fossilized and has been slowly accumulating over the last few hundred
                            million years and has acted as the storage of excess carbon. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <br>

                        <p>
                            In our rush to create the new petroleum and coal driven economy, this very
                            simple and fundamental fact has been ignored.Carbon that cycles through
                            living systems represents a fixed proportion of the planetary carbon, one
                            part solid, like the carbohydrates in trees and one part gas, as in
                            atmospheric Carbon Dioxide gas. If excess Carbon Dioxide enters the
                            atmosphere through tectonic processes such as volcanism, photosynthetic
                            activity removes this excess carbon dioxide from the biosphere and that
                            excess is deposited as fossils to enter the lithosphere(rocks), never to
                            interact with the biosphere again. This deposition is translated into vast
                            quantities of fossilized carbon that has been removed from the
                            biotic/atmospheric cycles. Unlike the biotic cycles of Carbon that stay
                            deposited for tens of thousands of years. The fossil pools have deposition
                            lifetimes of tens or hundreds of millions of years.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            There have been fluctuations of Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere in the
                            past but equilibrium was gained and balance was restored. All this was long
                            before humans.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The first human driven change that affected the local and regional climates
                            was the massive loss of the global forest stock with the advent of
                            colonization. This loss represents a debt to every nation that lost its forests
                            as well as a debt to planetary atmospheric equilibrium. This debt can be
                            settled by re-establishing the sequestered stocks of carbon that were lost by
                            reforestation. But once this debt is settled there will be no more room on this
                            planet to plant more trees to sequester the fossil carbon that is currently
                            being released so irresponsibly.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Fossil carbon is the principal driver of climate change. As a substance that is
                            over at least twenty million or more years older than the timber of the
                            forests that were lost, it represents a material with a far higher carbon cost
                            than a forest. It is also a fact that the levels of Carbon Dioxide, a major
                            atmospheric gas are increasing in the atmosphere. This increase is linked to
                            the destabilization of the climate, the burning of the fossil stock of Carbon
                            being the principal driver of change. It is now very clear that the stability of
                            planetary climate cycles are in jeopardy and a very large contributory factor
                            to this crisis is the profligate activities of modern human society. It is the
                            same activity that fuels the current vision of ‘Economic Development’ in Sri
                            Lanka. The entire infrastructural investment, be it stadia, complexes or
                            towers, require enormous amounts of energy for their operation. As our
                            sustainable energy production is abysmally low, we will have to provide fossil
                            energy to maintain this infrastructure, an activity patently destructive of the
                            global climate equilibrium.

                                Another area of concern is that the system of agriculture that our farmers
                                have been lured into. Through this type of agriculture they have been made
                                addicts to fossil fuel energy for motive power and fertilizers. Not only do we
                                loose vast sums of money and add to a decline in health, both human and
                                environmental; we also have this nation adding yet another burden to the
                                planets climate stability. In short we are ‘bankrupt’ as an independent,
                                agricultural nation, also very cynical if we ever claim to be ‘green’ on any
                                international stage.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        
                        <p>
                            On the wider picture, it is common knowledge, that there is a value
                            difference between fossil derived Carbon Dioxide and biologically cycling
                            Carbon Dioxide, but this fact has been ignored by the so-called ‘scientists’
                            who run the IPCC. Any high school child will know this fact, but it is ignored
                            by the ‘climate scientists’ who claim to know best. Whatever their motives,
                            the value differential of these cycles, biotic and fossil, must be recognized.
                            Biotic carbon operates on time frames of tens or hundreds of thousands of
                            years and fossil carbon in tens or hundreds of millions years. Further, fossil
                            carbon never interacts with the living or biotic cycle. Fossil carbon entering
                            the biotic cycle is the fundamental reason as to why there is an accelerating
                            climate change effect. However, the growing of trees to compensate for
                            fossil carbon and paying the same price as for biotic carbon is unfair and
                            tantamount to ‘carbon laundering’. There is no way to equate the carbon
                            from oil and coal with the carbon from a forest. One has a space in the biotic
                            cycle the other does not. Carbon that cycles through living systems
                            represents a fixed proportion of the planetary carbon thus there is no space
                            in the atmosphere for fossil derived Carbon Dioxide.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Carbon Dioxide is extracted from the atmosphere by plants and converted
                            into a solid form. This process has been hailed as a tool by which the
                            problem of increasing gaseous Carbon can be addressed. ‘Plant trees which
                            soak up the carbon dioxide’ the reasoning goes ‘and you can contribute to
                            reducing the atmospheric burden of that gas’. Living woody biomass has
                            been the first and logical candidate to be used as a potential tool in
                            sequestering atmospheric carbon and has been featured largely in ‘Carbon
                            capture’ projects. Although the volume of living biomass has now been
                            measured on most global models of carbon cycling and this measure is being
                            used in the evaluation of carbon stocks, there is a an urgent need to address
                            the fundamental differences between the components of living biomass,
                            photosynthetic biomass and respiring biomass.

                            Photosynthetic biomass performs the act of primary production, the initial
                            step in the manifestation of life. The biomass so termed has the ability to
                            increase in mass through the absorption of solar or other electromagnetic
                            radiation while releasing oxygen and water vapour into the atmosphere.
                            Respiring biomass is that component of living biomass that uses the output
                            of photosynthesis to make the complicated biological patterns of life; it
                            consumes oxygen to power its functions, and does not have photosynthetic
                            functions itself. This distinction would seem to be fundamentally important
                            when assessing the value of biomass that is being addressed. It is only this
                            photosynthetic biomass which powers carbon sequestration, carbohydrate
                            production, oxygen generation and water transformation, i.e. all actions
                            essential for the sustainability of the life support system of the planet.

                        <p>
                            Yet currently, it is only one product of this photosynthetic biomass, as
                            sequestered carbon, usually represented by wood/timber, that is recognized
                            as having commercial value in the carbon market for mitigating climate
                            change. The ephemeral part, the leaves, are generally ignored, yet the
                            photosynthetic biomass in terrestrial ecosystems are largely composed of
                            leaves, this component needs a value placed on it for its ‘environmental
                            services’.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It is not difficult to place value on photosynthetic biomass today. Initial
                            computations are based on the current values of the carbon market are
                            currently in excess of 125 billion dollars, assuming that the global market
                            would pay at least a similar amount to maintain our life support system, the
                            93.1 billion tons of photosynthetic Carbon currently in stock would be
                            roughly worth about 1.35 dollars per kilogram.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It is this biomass that has to grow in order to sequester the lost biotic
                            Carbon. With such growth we will see more Oxygen, Carbon sequestering
                            and water cleansing, throughout the planet. Much of the biomass to be
                            gained is in degraded ecosystems around the planet, these areas are also
                            home to the worlds rural poor, but what these degraded ecosystems do
                            have, is great growth potential for generating photosynthetic biomass. If the
                            restoration of these degraded ecosystems to achieve optimal photosynthetic
                            biomass loads becomes a global goal, the amazing magic of photosynthesis
                            could indeed help change our current dire course, create a new paradigm of
                            growth and make the planet more benign for our children.

                        <p>
                            Instead of flogging the dead horse of fossil energy based growth as
                            ‘Economic Development’, will we have the commonsense to appreciate the
                            value of photosynthetic biomass and become the first country in the world to
                            propose setting such a value? The realization of which will enrich not only
                            our rural population but rural people the world over!
