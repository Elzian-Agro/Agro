      "brief": "Dr. Ranil explains how Analog forestry can positively impact on organic & regenerative agriculture. Dr. Ranil’s original 17-acre model analog forest in Sri Lanka (now over 40 years, established) actively demonstrates that the restoration and protection of rainforests and natural resources is compatible with the economic wellbeing of rural communities. With his 60+ years of experience in the field of Forestry and Ecology sector and as the leading scientist of the Earth Restoration Foundation and a director of the International Analog Forestry Network, he believes in rapid digital inclusion in sustainable development efforts.",
